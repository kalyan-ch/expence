2. Users should be able to view their spending trends in each category on weekly, monthly and yearly intervals.
3. Users should be able to create financial goals.
4. Users should be able to create budgets on their categories

## Expense creation

User can create multiple expenses in whatever currency they like. They can specify income amount so the total amount after all the expenses can be calculated and they can adjust the expense amounts based on that calculation.

```java
class User {

    Currency currency;
}

class Expense {
    int userId;
    String name;
    String type;
    double amount;
    Date dueDate;
    double limit;
}

class Expenditure {

    Date timePeriod;
    List<Expense> expenses;
    double totalExpenditure;
    double income;
}
```

```java
class Metrics {

}
```

## Goals

    Date goalDate;
}
```
